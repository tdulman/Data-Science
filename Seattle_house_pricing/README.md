# Seattle-AirBnB-Analysis
Analysis of AirBnB listings of Seattle for 2019-2020

## Motivation
This project allows a business analysis of AirBnB listings of Seattle. It asks and answers 3 questions :<br/>

How Do Reviews Effects Pricing?<br/>
How Do Room Types Effect Pricing?<br/>
How Do Neighborhood Effects Pricing?<br/>
This is a part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree course.
## Files
Seatle_Airbnb.ipynb - it contains the code and graphs for the analysis<br/>

calendar.csv - it is a zipped file containing the day wise availability<br/>
reviews.csv - it is a summary version of reviews containing only the date, listing id and reviewer id.<br/>
listings.csv - it is a summary version of listings containing host id, listing id, neighborhood, availability etc.<br/>
## Libraries used
pandas,numpy,seaborn,shapefile and matplotlib.pyplot
## Summary of results
1. The prices are effected by room type.<br/>
2. The prices are effected by neighborhood.<br/>
3. The prices are not effected by rating.<br/>
## Acknowledgements
Some of the resources which were useful for the analysis and inspiration were:<br/>

Inside AirBnB which provided the labelled dataset
Ashwani Dhankhar's article on medium
Udacity Nanodegree for the project inspiration
## Future work
1. These findings can be used for a comparative analysis with other nearby cities like San Francisco.
2. Deep analysis can be done to understand why there is no relation between rating score and price.
